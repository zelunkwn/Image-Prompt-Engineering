# 🔥 Image Prompt Engineering  
Advanced research on structured prompt design for **selfies and photography** in generative AI.  
This repository provides a documented framework for building **high-accuracy, identity-preserving prompts** with clear sections (Scene, Clothing, Hair, Expression, Pose, Camera, Lighting, etc.).

## 📖 About  
This repo is a **lite version** of my full documentation on *Image Prompt Engineering*.  
It focuses on creating prompts that generate **consistent, realistic, and context-aware images** while preserving reference identity across outputs.  

The framework includes:  
- 📷 **Selfie Prompt Sections** → with pose and shot details specific to handheld/selfie context.  
- 🎞 **Photography Prompt Sections** → structured prompts for wider photographic compositions.  
- ⚡ **Generative Prompt Conversion** → how to merge descriptive sections into a final cohesive prompt.  
- ✅ **Negative/Avoid Guidelines** → prevent unwanted distortions (plastic skin, elongated necks, oversharpening, etc.).

## 🛠️ Usage  
1. Choose **Selfie** or **Photography** framework depending on the task.  
2. Fill in each section with accurate details (Scene, Clothing, Hair, Expression, etc.).  
3. Merge into a **Final Generative Prompt** for consistent, identity-preserving results.  
4. (Optional) Use alongside **reference images** for stronger accuracy.  

Example (Selfie):  
```text
Generate a realistic handheld selfie of the same person: indoors in a dimly lit public venue with blurred metallic structures, oversized black hoodie (hood up with zipper detail), medium-length dark brown hair slightly messy with strands tucked behind ears, relaxed smile and natural gaze. Close-up handheld selfie at arm’s length, low-up tilt (~10°), centered framing, warm overhead light with soft shadows, natural matte skin with subtle pores and faint freckles, slight motion blur, minor grain, soft edges, candid cozy intimate selfie mood.
```
📌 Why This Matters

Preserves facial identity and body proportions.

Produces consistent image quality across variations.

Prevents common generative issues (plastic skin, incorrect lighting, loss of identity).

Helps standardize prompt-writing for visual research.
